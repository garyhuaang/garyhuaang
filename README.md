🙋‍♂️ Hey! My name is Gary and welcome to my github! I started my programming journey about ~4 years ago.
🏫 I graduated from the California Polytechnic University of Pomona with my BS in Computer Science.
- Front end technologies: JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, SASS
- Back end technologies: work in progress 😓
- I’m currently solidifying my front end background and really looking forward to working the entire web stack!
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything if help is needed!
- Please contact me at: garyhuaang@gmail.com
